# About The Project
While making this project we tried to come up with solution to the following problems,
1. Where to Start
2. Organized Learning
3. EdTech for rural India

> Where to start
- Everyone wants to learn new skills which is easy. But, the difficult part is WHERE TO START? People often get lost and confused in their quest of the find the best course, to address this issue we have included simple and easy to understand Roadmaps which is a step by step guide explaining the course module.

> Organized Learning
- An issue we face when it comes to learning multiple skills is time management. To address this issue we have included a "Video Tutorial" section with a quick checklist and which also gives you an option to track your progress, so that you have a clear understanding of where you are, how well you are doing. This feature helps you manage your course moudule and will also allow you to learn new skills all at the same time! 

> EdTech for Rural India
- Urban and Rural students often face differences in terms of financial conditions, exposure, language, etc. despite this, they all deserve a friendly platform to learn. To bridge this gap we have made a compilation of best learning video by expects and made them availble on one platform, for quick and easy leaning we have also made documentation readily available on our website.

The flow of the website is as follows 
1. choose which skill you want to learn Frontend / backend / React
2. Study the detailed roadmap 
3. check the video resources for step by step guide 
4. track your progress on "progress tracker"
5. Refer the documentation for quick revision
