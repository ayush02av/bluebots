# About The Project
While making this project we tried to come up with solution to 3 problems
1. Where to Start
2. Organized Learning
3. EdTech for rural India

> Where to start
- Everyone wants to learn new skills and deciding which skill to learn is easy. But, the difficult part is WHERE TO START? People often get lost on this huge web in the quest of the best, to address this issue we have included simple and easy to understand Roadmaps with a quick checklist and the option to track your progress, so that you have a clear understanding of where you are, how well are you doing and what more is left. 

> Organized Learning
- An issue we face when it comes to learning multiple skills is management and how to find the right resources ? To address this issue we have included a "Video Tutorial" section 

> EdTech for Rural India
- Urban and Rural students often face differences in terms of financial conditions, exposure, language, etc. despite this, they all deserve a friendly platform to learn.
